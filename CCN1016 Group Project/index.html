						The idea of Artificial Intelligence first appeared during the second world war. A British computer scientist Alan Turing created the Bombe machine which used to crack the Enigma code. The Bombe machine laid the development for machine learning as it let Turing noticed that machine could also use the information it had to solve problems and make decisions, same as what human could do. The finding of Turing rises the concept of artificial intelligence in every scientist mind at the 1950s.
						<br>
						Form 1950s until now, the technology on Artificial Intelligence had improved at a stunning speed. It even involves in our daily life, like Siri in iPhone, self-driving vehicles and robotic vacuum cleaner. With the above examples we could find out the current trend of Artificial Intelligence is machine learning technology and the most representative machine in this area nowadays is AlphaGo.

						In the second place, Artificial Intelligence nowadays is a blessing for various business firms namely customer relationship marketing, financial services, and Human resource management. 
						<br>
						Take marketing firms as an example, AI is vital for building rapport among customers by asking their preferences of the products and services, identifying customers purchase history and personalizing innovative online advertisements with to achieve profit maximizing and gaining higher sales volume.  
						<br>
						AI, on the other hand, not only provides an in-depth analysis for investors’ financial positions via the AI FinCheck attaining their financial goal without extra hires but also prevents potential finance frauds, anti-money launderings which can be found in Bank of America and Citibank respectively. 
						<br>
						AI is also a magical poison for human resource recruitments, through conducting a comprehensive assessment of candidates’ verbal and nonverbal languages in skype platform and searching the right contracts, resumes and persons in a matter of time.

						For the gaming industry, we could say that Artificial Intelligence changed almost everything in this aspect.
						<br>
						First of all, making games smarter, in the past, the action of non-player characters (NPCs) is control by scripting which mean a fixed pattern. With AI those character able to learn from the movement of the players and change their response, like the Nintendo’s in a real-time pet simulation video game.
						<br>
						Second, games become more realistic, with the help of 3D visualization techniques, the graphic of a game could even jump out from the screen like the reality’s AR graphic dragon appear in a game ceremony at 2017.
						<br>
						Last but not least, game developer skills are transforming. Besides the traditional game development skills, the developers also need to learn the concept of function-based movements, pathfinding and genetic algorithms etc. as they aim to embed AI algorithms and techniques more seamlessly into traditional game development.

						Artificial Intelligence is a double-edged knife. It brings both convenient and risk. We must find a balance when using it. The following are some drawbacks.
						<br>
						First, AI will cause unemployment problem. When AI continuous developing, it can finish more tasks which are now done by humans. It will replace humans and humans will become unnecessary in many jobs. Therefore, it led to a large-scale of unemployment. Many people cannot maintain a livelihood, and it will become a great disaster to the whole world.
						<br>
						Second, people will over-reliance to AI. AI can help us to finish many things in everyday life and people will be over-dependent on it. For example, the phone assistance, Siri, can help the users to manage their life process, the users will not need to use their thinking and memory abilities. Therefore, those abilities will gradually decrease. At last, people may turn fully dependent on AI and lose their mental capacities.
						<br>
						In short, AI is surely the future of our society. We must carefully handle it and have great prevention before the risk come true.
